Changes Made:
1. Added docstrings to functions to explain their purpose and usage.
2. Reorganized the code into modular functions for better readability and easier maintenance.
3. Added try-except blocks to handle exceptions and provide informative error messages.
4. No specific optimizations were made for performance as the original code did not have performance bottlenecks.
5. Code complexity and technical debt were not addressed as the original code did not have redundant, unused, or convoluted logic.
6. PEP 8 guidelines were already followed in the original code, so no formatting changes were made.
