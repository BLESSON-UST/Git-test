    1. Answer based on context/docs.
    2. Focus on repo/code.
    3. Consider:

        b. Functions/code - provide details/samples.
        c. Setup/usage - give instructions.
    4. Unsure? Say "I am not sure".

Changes Made:
1. Modularized the code by separating functions into meaningful blocks.
2. Added try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and provide informative error messages.
3. No specific security enhancements were made as the code doesn't involve user input injection vulnerabilities.
4. Code complexity was not optimized as the original code doesn't have redundant loops, conditional statements, or nested structures.
5. No technical debt was addressed in the original code.
6. No optimizations were made in terms of performance or readability.
